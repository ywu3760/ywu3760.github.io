As CSS has been given almost entire control over the style of a page, a lot of HTML tags have dropped off the map entirely.  That's a necessary evolution.<br /><br />The problem with having a limited number of tags, as you may have already discovered, is that your limited to the number of styles you can redefine using CSS.  That's where <b><i>selectors</i></b> come in.<br /><br />A CSS selector is something that indicates a relationship between two or more HTML tags.  By using the selectors, you can streamline your styles.  For example, you can use the 'space' selector to indicate that only children of a certain tag are to be styled in the specified way.<br /><br />You'll see a few selectors in the construction, enough to understand the concept.  CSS has a ton of these selectors, though, and you should take advantage of your resources to look them up and use them.",slides:[{text:"This is your HTML.  Rather than build it piece by piece, just type it all in and then have a look at it.  The benefit of having it all at once is that we'll be able to see how this develops as we start adding CSS code to it.<br /><br />Notice that there is a CSS file called cstick.css linked at the top.  Create this file. All of your CSS code will go into the file.<br /><br />Make sure you have the <a href = 'lessons/css selectors/candleside.PNG'>Candlestick Background Picture</a> stored in the folder with your HTML and CSS files.",image:"step1.PNG"},{text:"Let's start writing this CSS file.<br /><br />Backgrounds are tough.  Novice programmers are always looking for some crazy colorful background that will really give their pages some pizzaz.  The trouble is that backgrounds, if they're too 'pizzazzy', can overwhelm your page.<br /><br />Try this.",image:"step2.PNG"},{text:"It made a mess.<br /><br />In the first place, the background doesn't really work well with the black text (we'll handle that later).  Secondly, the page will repeat the image over and over again in order to fill up the screen.<br /><br />This image really works better as more of a sidebar.  We don't want it to repeat.<br /><br />The background-repeat property handles this.  We use no-repeat here, but you can also use repeat-x and repeat-y to get it repeating along a single axis.",image:"step3.PNG"},{text:"If you're using a sidebar image, it may not reach all the way from top to bottom.  It needs to be long enough to look good, but it doesn't have to reach the whole page.  It depends on what you're going for.  For this, we center the background image on the left margin.  This should, ultimately, have the desired effect.<br /><br />See what it looks like.",image:"step4.PNG"},{text:"The side image should be long enough to handle any resolution, but that won't account for scrolling.  Just in case our content reaches past the height of the page, we want to fix my image in place so that the text will scroll over it and the image itself will not move.<br /><br />For this, use the background-attachment property.<br /><br />If you want to test this, just add a whole lot of 'br' tags to your HTML and try it out.",image:"step5.PNG"},{text:"Finally, in order to blend the image with the screen itself, change the background color.  The color used is the darkest color in the image itself.  Finding colors isn't difficult.  You can go into any drawing utility (like Microsoft Paint), select the color you want with the eyedropper, and just check the RGB or hex values.<br /><br />If the color doesn't match well, play with the values a bit.  You can test it right on your web page or find an online color picker.",image:"step6.PNG"},{text:"Now that the background is all set up, choose a foreground color that works with your page.  For this page, antiquewhite goes nicely with the theme.<br /><br />Most often, choosing colors and fonts will be an exercise in trial and error.  You try and zero in on what you like as best you can, but you will often have to tweak your page just to get the right look and feel for it.<br /><br />This is one of the reasons that it's best to work back to front.  That means you program the back end first.  This particular project is all design, but most projects won't be like that.<br /><br />Try it and see how it's coming.",image:"step7.PNG"},{text:"Next up is a navigation panel.  We'll make that out of the list.  Lists are very useful for things like navigation panels and menus.

If the link is new, it's blue.  Otherwise it's purple.  They're also underlined.<br /><br />You can change any of those features with straight CSS.  Here, we're changing the color.  Since we are setting a specific color for the anchor tag, it will always be that color whether it's a new or visited link.<br /><br />The other question is why do we have to set the color of the link to antique white when we've already set that coor in the body.  The answer to that question is, because of they're not just text, they don't just inherit the style of the parent.",image:"step9.PNG"},{text:"Anchor tags are special in a couple of different ways.<br /><br />In the first place, they have their own styling.

Because of this, there's a domino effect which affects the whole page.<br /><br />When dealing with margins and other placement properties, it's important to take the possibility of varying resolutions into account.  But, since all top left corners are (0, 0), you can gauge distances.",image:"step12.PNG"},{text:"Here, we're styling the main text in the paragraph.  We've pushed that much further from the left than the navigation panel.  Ultimately, we'll bring it up so that they're aligned.<br /><br />We've also used the margin-right property.  Using a straight up pixel measurement with righthand and bottom margins is dangerous, because you never know the resolution of the client machine.  Here, however, we're setting a limit.  No matter how wide the screen, we want our text to end 150 pixels before the righthand margin.<br /><br />You can try this now.  The next step will finally introduce a selector.",image:"step13.PNG"},{text:"To round out some of the basic page styling, formate the headers.<br /><br />Note that the first block works for h1, h2, AND h3.  Since they share some common property values, we can set them all together.  For the font-size, which is different for each one, we list them separately.",image:"step14.PNG"},{text:"In the HTML, there is a span around each instance of the word 'candlestick'.  The purpose of this code is to color them in flaming orange, so that they stand out.<br /><br />There is, however, also a span around the title inside the h1, which I don't want to be flaming orange.<br /><br />The space in between the 'p' and the 'span' is called the 'descendant' selector. A CSS selector is a way to SELECT a specific tag as opposed to all of the tags of that type. It's a character that connects 2 or more tag identities so that you can differentiate between certain tags and all of the others of the same type.<br /><br />The descendant selector chooses only children of a specific tag.  The code, as it's written, should be read as, 'select all of the span tags that are descendants (children, grandchildren, etc..) of 'p' tags.'<br /><br />Try it.",image:"step15.PNG"},{text:"We can also now style just the span that's inside the h1.<br /><br />The reason for having this span is so that we can put the backround color around just the text.  Remember that an h1 is a block element.  If you give it a background color, you'll have a ribbon of color across the whole screen.  The span is an inline element so the background color fits tightly around the content.<br /><br />The next thing on the list is to move up the text so that it is better aligned with the menu.",image:"step16.PNG"},{text:"Moving the paragraph up is a bit tricky.  We're using margins and margins are relative.  That means that the paragraph starts at margin-top:0, relative to the navigation panel, which comes directly before it.<br /><br />If we want to move the the text up, we need to set a negative margin.  The code alters its current margin by -200, which brings it UP 200 pixels relative to the navigation panel.<br /><br />Playing with margins is difficult.  You'll need to practice with it in order to master it.  Again, working with specific pixel values works here because we're in control of the navigation panel.  If the size of the panel was dynamic (say the number of links varied based on certain conditions), we couldn't accurately position the paragraph in this way.<br /><br />If you try this, you'll see that it had the right effect, but messed up the copyright text.",image:"step17.PNG"},{text:"If we want to move the copyright text down, we have to style the 'div'.  Unfortunately, it's not our only 'div' and it's not a descendant of anything.<br /><br />In order to access that specific 'div', we'll use another selector.<br /><br />The plus sign (+) selects the next immediate sibling.  This says that the page should style any div which comes directly after another div at the same level.<br /><br />There are a wide variety of selectors available through CSS.  They can be used in the simple examples like we've done or they can be woven into complex webs of CSS mayhem.  Only with practice, can you master them.<br /><br />Check out the Poker and Ice Cream Sisters sample pages.",image:"step18.PNG"}]}, 
{title:"CSS Classes", objective:"Objective: To understand how to apply styles to HTML elements using classes.", description:"The word 'class' is short for 'classification'. When designers started tooling around with object oriented programming, they started with something called structs, short for structures. These were pretty simple starter objects that held properties only (no functions). Functions were quickly added and structs gave way to classes.<br /><br />When classes were designed for CSS, they were done so with this same idea in mind. <i><b>Oh, you have that bunch of span tags and you want them all to have red text? Let's make a class of span tags and redefine them.</i></b><br /><br />All of this boils down to organization and minimization of code. Designing your front end can be at least as hard as programming the logic. Using classes helps to put everything in its place. Remember to plan everything out ahead of time.<hr />",slides:[{text:"Before we begin, you'll need to download the <a href = 'lessons/css classes/woods.zip'>index and images</a> for the construction. Place them into their own folder and open index.html in your editor. Create a file called woods.css and open that in your editor as well. We'll be working in there first.<br /><br />The illustrated code sets up the background image for the page.  Notice that the code specifies the html tag instead of the body and 'vh' and 'vw' for the measurements of the size.<br /><br />The html tag represents the whole document, whereas the body represents the container of the content.<br /><br />The measurements for the size of the background image refer to viewport width and viewport height.  Each unit represent 1% of the size of your window.  That means that 100vw is 100% of the viewport width.  What this does is it makes the image adjustable with the window itself.",image:"step1.PNG"},{text:"If you haven't looked at the page yet, you should.<br /><br />That background image probably seems overwhelming, but we'll get to that in time. Right now, let's concern ourselves with those pandas. Their purpose is to become a special kind of bullet for our list.  That's why we've assigned them a 'class' attribute.<br /><br />The purpose of a class in HTML/CSS is to get a group of elements all styled and behaving the same way.  The pandas are images, but there will be more images later on that will have a different styling.",image:"step2.PNG"},{text:"Using a class is a 2 step process.  The first step is in the HTML, where you assign a class attribute to the HTML element.  You can assign the same class name to as many elements as you like.  They don't even need to all be the same type of element.<br /><br />The selector for a class is the dot (.).<br /><br />The code shows that all img tags with the class name of 'bullet' should be styled a certain way.  If I were to have other tags with the same class name, I could access them individually by using the individual tag names.<br /><br />I can also omit the tag name and have the class be affected universally.<br /><br /><b><i>.bullet</i></b>",image:"step3.PNG"},{text:"We want to hide those pandas for the time being.  There are a few ways to do this, but we want them completely gone so we'll work with display.<br /><br />CSS has a 'display' property which allows a programmer to change the way an element is displayed on screen.  Four of the values are:<br /><br />none - The element is removed from the page entirely.<br />block - The element becomes a block element.<br />inline - The element becomes an inline element.<br />inline-block - The element generates a block box, but is placed as an inline element.<br /><br />If you're thinking hard about this, you should be realizing that the display property invalidates one of an HTML element's most basic characteristics.  It no longer matters whether or not an element is block or inline because you can just change it.<br /><br />Understanding 'block' and 'inline' is extremely important for design work, especially if you want to use inline-block, which is very powerful.  If you're confused about the distinction, you should review it.",image:"step4.PNG"},{text:"The code affects li and span tags.  By adding background colors, the text pops off of the page, downplaying the effect of the background image.<br /><br />From running this code, what do you learn about li tags?",image:"step5.PNG"},{text:"That's right!  They're block elements.  Since block elements are so big (the width of the window), they become adjustable.<br /><br />Note that the width, height, and padding adjustments are just for the li tags.  The numbers were arrived at after much trial and error.<br /><br />Also, we won't be needing the li bullets.<br /><br />Now look.  What do you think?",image:"step6.PNG"},{text:"This next step focuses on the header.  Centering the h1 will push the span and its text to the middle of the page.  Trapping that text in the span is very important.  Run the page and see if you can figure out why.<br /><br />We've also brought the heading away from the top of the screen using a margin.  Remember that margins push elements.  Because of the static flow of the page, and this being the first element on the page, this margin change affects everything.  By pushing the heading down 100 pixels, everything else is also pushed down 100 pixels.",image:"step7.PNG"},{text:"Use padding here to give the title a little bit of room in its cell.<br /><br />We've used the descendant CSS selector.  We could have used a class (you can use a class pretty much anywhere), but classes are extra HTML and this particular styling is unique to a single element.",image:"step8.PNG"},{text:"Back in the HTML file, we add 2 events to our li tags.<br /><br />We want the display image to show the appropriate picture every time our mouse crosses over one of the list items.  In order to make that happen, we're going to make use of 2 Javascript events.<br /><br />onmouseover is triggered whenever the mouse pointer passes into the HTML element.<br />onmouseout is triggered whenever the mouse pointer passes out of the HTML element.",image:"step9.PNG"},{text:"Both of the events call the toggleImage() function, which we haven't written yet.  When the mouse is over the element, an image name is passed in.  When the mouse leaves the element, an empty string is passed in.  This is significant as we want the image to show up onmouseover and we want it to disappear onmouseout.<br /><br />Notice the use of single quotes around the image name.  In Javascript, single and double quotes are interchangeable.  However, since we are using the event as an HTML attribute, it's already in double quotes.  If we tried to open another double quote for the image name, the browser would think we were closing the old double quote and that would cause an imbalance in the page.",image:"step9.PNG"},{text:"Let's write some Javascript!<br /><br />Start by grabbing hold of your display image and putting it into a Javascript HTML object.  For this project, this is the only element we'll need.",image:"step10.PNG"},{text:"The toggleImage function handles the display of the image.

If there's no image name, then I want the function to know that the user does not have the mouse pointer on an li and the image should be hidden.<br /><br />By using the style object of the HTML element, we can access the CSS display property and set it to 'none'.  This will remove it from the page completely.",image:"step12.PNG"},{text:"Otherwise, the mouse pointer is on one of the li tags and we want to show the proper image.  The image file name has been passed into imageName so we can set the src attribute directly through the HTML object.<br /><br />We also need to make the image visible again, so we set the display to 'inline', which is the default display value for an img tag.<br /><br />Try it.",image:"step13.PNG"},{text:"Back in woods.css, it's not quite where we want it yet.  We'll have to play with the display image a bit before things are perfect.<br /><br />In addition to accessing elements through classes, you can access them through their ids.  The selector for an id is the hash tag (#).<br /><br />Rememeber that ids should always be unique.",image:"step14.PNG"},{text:"If you're working in Chrome, you probably don't see any sign of the display image when you load the page.  Remember that we didn't bother to give the img tag a value for src.  If you don't remember that, go look at your HTML.",image:"step14.PNG"},{text:"Some browsers will consider that an error and put a broken image icon on the screen.  We don't want that.  The easiest way to deal with it is to hide the image from the outset (which is consistent with our Javascript function), using the display property.<br /><br />When the page loads, this image will be hidden.  Because of the Javascript we wrote, it will go on and off like a light when we bring our mouse pointer over the li tags.",image:"step15.PNG"},{text:"The next thing to do is give it a little (okay, a big) push off of the margin.  By using a percentage instead of a fixed measurement, the image will always be roughly centered on the page.",image:"step16.PNG"},{text:"Finally, we push it up by giving it a negative top margin.  Once again, these numbers were arrived through trial and error.  In the end, though, it works nicely.<br /><br />Setting a specific height gives the page a consistent feel.  This way, no matter what the size of your images, the browser will adjust them so that they all look about the same.<br /><br />Be careful with adjusting the sizes of images.

A span  tag is an inline tag.  A div tag, if we had chosen to use it, is a block tag.  We don't want either of those.<br /><br />inline-block tags are block tags that are displayed as inline.  This means they take up the whole line by default, but can be resized (like block tags).  When you resize them, though, other tags can fit onto the line (like inline tags).",image:"step4.PNG"},{text:"If you tried the code, you'll see that it didn't change anything.  Like I said, changing the display to inline-block keeps the element as a block element.  We need to change the width.<br /><br />Since we're working with 3 columns, we'll go with 25%.<br /><br />I know that makes it sound like we're styling for 4 columns but we're not.<br /><br />Remember that if you start dressing up your columns with padding and borders, you'll expand them.

If you link your most abstract files, like this columns file, first and then change some of the values in later files or even in the HTML document itself, the browser will always use what it sees LAST.",image:"step5.PNG"},{text:"The next thing is to get them lined up.  Since the crawls are different lengths, word-wise, you have to figure out how you want them to look.  I like things that are aligned to the top, but HTML always seems to align to the bottom.<br /><br />Fortunately, there's a thing for that.<br /><br />vertical-align will check out the height of all of the siblings on the line and push them all up to the top.

That just centers whatever is INSIDE the block element.  If you want the whole element centered itself, you need to adjust its margins.  Setting them to 'auto' balances them on both sides.<br /><br />The question is, why center them at all?<br /><br />When creating a column based page, centering the columncontainers creates a symmetery on the page.  Sometimes, it won't be necessary and it can be overridden in a CSS setting more specific to that page.<br /><br />You can try this now.",image:"step9.PNG"},{text:"What do you mean it didn't work?  Of course it worked!  You just can't see it.<br /><br />Why can't you see it?<br /><br />Because the width of the container is virtually 100%.  When there is no space, there's nothing to balance.<br /><br />You can try changing the width of the columncontainer to 90% and see what happens.  It will move it, but that's not enough.  We also don't want to take responsibility for the width of the container because most people will change that.  After you've finished the experiment, take out any adjustments to the width of the container.",image:"step9.PNG"},{text:"What we need to do, however, is center everything inside of it.  This gives the page... you guessed it... symmetry.  Someone using the file may want to do more with what's inside the columns, but our CSS file provides the framework.<br /><br />That's all it's designed to do.<br /><br />You should have columns now.

Let's change that to justified.<br /><br />Pretty, right?",image:"step16.PNG"},{text:"No, really.  It is.  I know that the columns are butted up against each other, which looks terrible, but the justified text looks so much better than the centered text.<br /><br />The text was originally centered because we centered everything inside of the container.

Let's add the prequels to the mix.  We can use the same format with the span, h2, and p tags.

    faq: [{question:"With classes, why do I need any other CSS selectors?",answer:"Classes are pretty powerful, but that doesn't mean you should just forget that there are any others.
