# Things to keep note of:
* The folder "KATAN-shopping-website-version_5" contains the latest version of the project.
* The other versions are included in this zip file because they will show you the project at its different development stages.
* This project is scalable, meaning that it can still work properly even as you add more products into the database.
* THIS IS NOT A BUG: The website will purposely refresh itself whenever you resize the browser window. This is to prevent any weird text fonts or sizes that may arise since I'm borrowing a file called "jquery.fittext", which automatically stylizes text according to its surroundings.
* Giving credit where credit is due: Most of the product images that I am using came from the MUJI store but everything else is fictional and original.
