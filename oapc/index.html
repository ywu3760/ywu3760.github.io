                <div class="education-info">Ocean Acidification describes the process of ocean water becoming <span>more acidic</span> over time as a result of absorbing <span>increasing amounts</span> of carbon dioxide.</div>

            <div class="education-info-1">A <span>majority</span> of the compound can be traced to <span>human activity</span> such as emissions from vehicles that use <span>nonrenewable fuel</span>, <span>deforestation</span>, and the burning of <span>fossil fuels</span> for energy.</div>

            <div class="education-info-1">On the pH scale, with a pH of 1 being the <span>most acidic</span>, ocean water pH has <span>fallen by 0.1</span> to around 8.1 since approximately 200 years ago. A 0.1 deficit may appear small, but the pH scale is actually logarithmic which means that ocean water has gotten around <span>30% more acidic</span>.</div>

                        Hello! I'm concerned about leading a comfortable life on Earth years after I graduate from high school. I created this website with the hope that I could raise greater awareness around the ever-worsening issue of ocean acidification. By providing people with information and facts that are easy to digest, I hope to inspire more people from all generations to take action and protect the wonderful oceans that we have yet to fully explore. Even though we are currently living among many crises, we mustn't forget that protecting this globe is still on our agenda.
