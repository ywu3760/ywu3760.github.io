                        Hello! I'm concerned about leading a comfortable life on Earth years after I graduate from high school. I created this website with the hope that I could raise greater awareness around the ever-worsening issue of ocean acidification. By providing people with information and facts that are easy to digest, I hope to inspire more people from all generations to take action and protect the wonderful oceans that we have yet to fully explore. Even though we are currently living among many crises, we mustn't forget that protecting this globe is still on our agenda.
