                        Let's admit it. The year 2020 will be one of the craziest years that we will ever live through: a formidable virus running rampant through the globe and headline-catching social unrest erupting in many countries. A desperate call for change in many systems like healthcare and policing is the talk everywhere now. However, we mustn't forget about the many goals that we were fighting for prioir to the explosion of these crises. Amongst many of these aspirations was to become better protectors of our globe. When I glance at the mirror, I'm just a regular high schooler leading a very mundane life just like you. I have niether the political power nor the economic upperhand to bring swift global reform. However, I have acquired-skills that enabled me to make a website about ocean acidification; and, I hope this website can educate and inspire more people to take more proactive action against the increasingly-perilous issue. RIght now, many of us are living in copable conditions and may feel that change isn't necessary, but history has shown that, from time to time, taking a proactive-stance instead of a reactive one will leave behind a better legacy for the future generations - if we wnat any.
