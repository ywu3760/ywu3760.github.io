            <div class="section-answer">This is an campaign designed to aid the fighting against ocean acidification by educating more people about what it does, what causes it, who hurts from it, and what actions can help slow/prevent it.</div>

            <div class="section-answer">Let's admit it. The year 2020 will be one of the craziest years that we will ever live through: a formidable virus running rampant through the globe and headline-catching social unrest erupting in many countries. A desperate call for change in many systems like healthcare and policing is the talk everywhere now. However, we mustn't forget about the many goals that we were fighting for before the explosion of these crises. Amongst many of these aspirations was to become better protectors of our globe. When I glance at the mirror, I'm just a regular high schooler leading a very mundane life just like you. I have neither the political power nor the economic upper hand to bring swift global reform. However, I have acquired-skills that enabled me to make a website about ocean acidification; and, I hope this website can educate and inspire more people to take more proactive action against the increasingly-perilous issue. Right now, many of us are living in manageable conditions and may feel that change isn't necessary, but history has shown that, from time to time, taking a proactive-stance instead of a reactive one will leave behind a better legacy for the future generations - if we want any.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Goals</div>
            <div class="section-answer">There are three goals that I will be looking for from my feedback form: 1) a huge number of visitors that didn't hear about the website from me, 2) polls indicating that they learned more about ocean acidification from the website, and 3) polls indiciating that the information and sources are easily assessible and comprehensible.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Advocacy Strategies</div>
            <div class="section-answer">Going Digital is one advocacy strategy from APUSH Period 9 that I employed for this project. This was one of the sole reasons why I didn't want to create a brochure because it would definitely limit my audience in this day and age. Movements such as the #MeToo and #blacklivesmatter started years ago and are still so prominent because their causes are digitalized, which makes it very accessible by their audience. Another advocacy strategy that I employed was driving this idea that "we can do it if we are all on board" with the campaign by completing simple actions on the personal scale that doesn't require any expensive commitment. This kind of strategy was really successful for Rosie the Riveter and the "We Can Do It!" campaign because it encouraged more women to join the war effort by simply helping out with battle supply productions without participating in the fighting. The strategy doesn't ask people to do complicated things; it just requests people to do what they can because every little effort matters to get to the final goal.</div>
